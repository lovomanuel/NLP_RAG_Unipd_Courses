"INNOVATION, ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND FINANCE Prerequisites: There are no particular knowledge prerequisites for taking this course. However, it should be noted that the course will be different from previous years due to the innovative teaching methods that will be adopted.Target skills and knowledge: Most of the meetings will be about learning with a tangible result at the end of each lesson.In other words, lengthy explanations based on slide projections, i.e. a traditional lecture, will be avoided as far as possible. In this logic, there will be many hours of study and review of notions.Alternatively, there will be learning sessions in which the acquisition of methods will be experimented with. In this logic, there will be laboratory experience in the application of methods.In addition to learning specific methods applicable to Innovation and Entrepreneurship, the potential of Generative Artificial Intelligence (in particular ChatGPT) will be learnt. The tool can usefully be used to support students' individual and group work.Examination methods: Each student will take 9 credits and no less than 9.The examination will focus on the Finance part. While the assessment of the learning of the Innovation and Entrepreneurship content will take place on the Project Work developed by groups of students.The written examination may contain problems with numerical solutions and multiple choices questions.Assessment criteria: All attending students are expected to participate in the workshops during the hours allocated to the course. Each workshop will add to the skills required to develop a group Project Work.Attendance with active participation in the course is therefore essential. Each individual group will be responsible for assessing the continuity and active participation of each of its members.The evaluation is therefore composed as follows:50% Project Work with equal assessment for all group members (for the Innovation and Entrepreneurship components)50% written examination with individual assessment (for the Finance component)Course unit contents: The Innovation part will consist of a pathway to develop the fundamental skills to identify and develop an innovative idea.The course will have the following phases- identification of a field of innovation (e.g. environment, healthcare, etc.)- identification of a relevant problem worthy of investigation- development of innovation skills to find a solution to the problem- identification of the most appropriate solution- reflection on the solution found and the process followedThe following topics will be explored and evaluated during the course- Future Trends and Emerging Technologies- Sustainability and Circular Economy- Innovation Case StudiesAll phases will be explored and developed through the use of Generative AI and in particular ChatGPT.The Entrepreneurship part will involve developing an innovative entrepreneurial project through a pathway in which all key areas of a start-up project are explored (excluding economic and financial aspects). It will start from the problem and its solution identified in the Innovation part by developing the part of the project that concerns the specifics of the entrepreneurial action.Then the following 10 areas will be considered:1. Team building,2. The identification of the entrepreneurial opportunity,3. The evaluation of the opportunity,4. The market analysis,5. The product concept and value proposition,6. The competitive analysis,7. The Intellectual property,8. The business model,9. Fundraising,10. The project presentationAll areas will be explored and developed through a synergetic use of ChatGPT.Participants will be able to develop skills that will be useful in their entrepreneurial journey. Each result generated through ChatGPT will have to be critically evaluated by the groups to make the most of the logic of 'augmented intelligence'.The following content will be covered in the Finance part:- The economic and financial model of the company- The formation of financial statements (income statement and balance sheet)- The structure of the balance sheet and the basic items of the income statement and balance sheet- Balance sheet analysis and the interpretation of values- The dynamics of financial flows- Simulation of the economic and financial aspects of a business planEach topic will be accompanied by class exercises.Planned learning activities and teaching methods: Students are invited to explore the potential and versatility of ChatGPT.In particular, ChatGPT can:Assume different analysis roles and perspectivesSuggest criteria to be used for different types of analysisGenerate questions on a specific topicGenerate result alternativesEvaluate alternatives and optionsAdditional notes about suggested reading: Students must have a PC or at least one for two available.Textbooks (and optional supplementary readings) Thomas H.
