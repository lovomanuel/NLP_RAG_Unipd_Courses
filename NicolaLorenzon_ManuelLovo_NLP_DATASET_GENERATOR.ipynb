This project allows students to demonstrate their ability to apply the knowledge and skills they have acquired throughout the course to solve complex problems. The thesis is a significant component of the master's degree program and is evaluated based on a final judgement.\\n\\n    Note on Study Plan Approval\\n    These courses constitute the study plan with automatic approval. Students may also select electives from other courses, but such choices must be approved by the commission of the University of Padua (UNIPD).\\n\",\n          \"Degree\\u00a0course: Second cycle degree in\\nCOMPUTER ENGINEERING\\nIN2547, Degree course structure A.Y. 2020/21,\\nA.Y. 2023/24 Degree course track: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND ROBOTICS [001PD] Number\\u00a0of\\u00a0ECTS\\u00a0credits\\u00a0allocated: 9.0 Type of assessment: Mark Course\\u00a0unit\\u00a0English\\u00a0denomination: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE Department\\u00a0of\\u00a0reference: Department of Information Engineering E-Learning\\u00a0website: https://stem.elearning.unipd.it/course/view.php?idnumber=2023-IN2547-001PD-2023-INQ3103090-N0-DEI Mandatory\\u00a0attendance: No Language\\u00a0of\\u00a0instruction: English Branch: PADOVA Single Course unit: The Course unit can be attended under the option Single Course unit attendance Optional Course unit: The Course unit can be chosen as Optional Course unit Course unit for Erasmus students: The course unit can be attended by Erasmus+ and other exchange students  Teacher in charge MARIA SILVIA PINI ING-INF/05Other\\u00a0lecturers GLORIA BERALDO \",\n          \"Degree\\u00a0course: Second cycle degree in\\nCOMPUTER ENGINEERING\\nIN2547, Degree course structure A.Y. 2020/21,\\nA.Y. 2023/24 Degree course track: BIOINFORMATICS [002PD] Number\\u00a0of\\u00a0ECTS\\u00a0credits\\u00a0allocated: 6.0 Type of assessment: Mark Course\\u00a0unit\\u00a0English\\u00a0denomination: INFERENTIAL STATISTICS Department\\u00a0of\\u00a0reference: Department of Information Engineering Mandatory\\u00a0attendance: No Language\\u00a0of\\u00a0instruction: English Branch: PADOVA Single Course unit: The Course unit can be attended under the option Single Course unit attendance Optional Course unit: The Course unit can be chosen as Optional Course unit Course unit for Erasmus students: The course unit can be attended by Erasmus+ and other exchange students  Teacher in charge ERLIS RULI SECS-S/01\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":19}],"source":["df = df[['course', 'content']]\n","df"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"N9hmAypEPvFK","outputId":"31e331ad-f7ff-4665-ffb5-e77d7166c02e","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1718983011823,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":7,"user":{"displayName":"nicola lorenzon","userId":"05495296986745705860"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0      AUTOMATA, LANGUAGES AND COMPUTATION Degree cou...\n","1      AUTOMATA, LANGUAGES AND COMPUTATION Prerequisi...\n","2      MACHINE LEARNING Degree course: Second cycle d...\n","3      MACHINE LEARNING Prerequisites: Basic Knowledg...\n","4      INFERENTIAL STATISTICS Degree course: Second c...\n","                             ...                        \n","103    Study Plan Digital Health and Clinical Enginee...\n","104    Study Plan Industrial Bioengineering track For...\n","105    Study Plan Biomedical Data Models and Analysis...\n","106    Study Plan Bioengineering for Neurosciences tr...\n","107    Study Plan Bioengineering for Rehabilitation t...\n","Name: Merged_Column, Length: 108, dtype: object\n"]}],"source":["# Merge two columns using the .str.cat() method\n","df['Merged_Column'] = df['course'].astype(str).str.cat(df['content'], sep=' ')\n","df = df['Merged_Column']\n","print(df)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_PF86OZolEyd"},"source":["##Dataset saving in different format\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"DSKR8sMJlP6J"},"source":["In these snippet of code, the dataset was saved in different formats, ready to be further processed by other tools."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"MhaFCKMHL5Os"},"outputs":[],"source":["df.to_csv('/content/drive/MyDrive/Lorenzon_Lovo_NLP/Assignment_2/Data/first_dataset.csv', index=False)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Sqmdnj0Y5EHV"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Open a file in write mode\n","with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:\n","    # Iterate through all rows using iloc\n","    for i in range(len(df)):\n","        text = df.iloc[i]\n","        text = text.replace('\\n', ' ')\n","        f.write(f\"Text {i}: {text}\\n\\n\")"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"am5tGlRS7q8a"},"outputs":[],"source":["!cp '/content/output.txt' '/content/drive/MyDrive/Lorenzon_Lovo_NLP/Assignment_2/Data/dataset.txt'"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1zstPNSG2XHwyWP28qBOeWoqYb9WcF53l","timestamp":1718893947828}],"collapsed_sections":["HESU1gpvTVYq","invFv8dKeTiw"]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
